# Planit

Planit is an event management marketplace. This was a group project completed during the tenth week of my web development program. My team took the opportunity to develop a granular Agile workflow and experience pair programming. We also built an SPA without a framework. I wouldn't recommend this, but it was a great learning experience. While I collaborated on many of the pieces, the majority of my focus was on the views and client-side javascript.

Features include:

* LinkedIn OAuth
* Customizable profiles
* As an event owner, you can create events, add tasks, review (and accept or reject) proposals
* As a contributor, you can propose to other users' tasks based the qualifications listed in your profile.
